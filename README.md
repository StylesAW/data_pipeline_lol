# data_pipeline_lol
This project automates the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of League of Legends statistics using Python and SQL. The pipeline is orchestrated with Apache Airflow via Astronomer, and the data is stored in Snowflake for analysis. The process ensures up-to-date, clean data ready for reporting and visualization.

This project is ready to be deployed to Astronomer and use Airflow.
